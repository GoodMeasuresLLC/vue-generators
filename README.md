# Vue::Generators
vue-generators is an opinionated library for generating Vue components, mixins, packs,
and stores for a Rails project.

## Usage

### Help
```bash
rails g vue:component -h
rails g vue:mixin -h
rails g vue:store -h
rails g vue:pack -h
```

### Generate a component

```bash
rails g vue:component ButtonCounter
```

**This will generate:**

*`app/javascript/components/ButtonCounter.vue`*
```JavaScript
<template>
  <div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'ButtonCounter',

  components: {},

  mixins: [],

  props: {
    /*
    property: {
      type: String|Number|Boolean|Array|Object|Date|Function|Symbol,
      default: null,
      required: false
    },
    */
  },

  data() {
    return {
      // field: 'value'
    }
  },

  computed: {
    // computed properties are cached based on their dependencies
    /*
    computedProperty() {
      return 'value'
    },
    */
  },

  methods: {
    // Methods run whenever a re-render happens, their results aren't cached.
    /*
    onClick() {
      this.$emit('click-happened')
    },
    */
  },

  mounted() {
    // Invoked when the component loads, good place to fetch data from the API
  },
}
</script>

<style lang="stylus" scoped>
</style>
```

### Generate a mixin

```bash
rails g vue:mixin MyMixin
```
**This will generate:**

*`app/javascript/mixins/MyMixin.js`*

```JavaScript
export default {
  props: {
    /*
    property: {
      type: String|Number|Boolean|Array|Object|Date|Function|Symbol,
      default: null,
      required: false
    },
    */
  },

  data() {
    return {
      // field: 'value'
    }
  },

  computed: {
    // computed properties are cached based on their dependencies
    /*
    computedProperty() {
      return 'value'
    },
    */
  },

  methods: {
    // Methods run whenever a re-render happens, their results aren't cached.
    /*
    onClick() {
      this.$emit('click-happened')
    },
    */
  },
}
```

### Generate a pack
```bash
rails g vue:pack admin
```

**This will generate:**
*`app/javascript/packs/admin.js`
```JavaScript
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

// Routing
const router = new VueRouter({
})

// Vuex
const store = new Vuex.Store({

})

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  Vue.use(VueRouter)

  const el = document.getElementById("root")

  const app = new Vue({
    el: el,
    template: "<div><router-view /></div>",
    components: {},
    router,
    store,
    mounted() {
    },
  })
})

```
### Generate a store

```bash
rails g vue:store Application
```

**This will generate:**

*`app/javascript/stores/application/Store.js`*
```JavaScript
import { actions }    from "./actions"
import { getters }    from "./getters"
import { mutations }  from "./mutations"
import { state }      from "./state"

export default {
  namespaced: true,

  actions:    actions,
  getters:    getters,
  mutations:  mutations,
  state:      state
}
```

*`app/javascript/stores/application/actions.js`*
```JavaScript
export const actions = {

}
```

*`app/javascript/stores/application/getters.js`*
```JavaScript
export const getters = {

}
```

*`app/javascript/stores/application/mutations.js`*
```JavaScript
export const mutations = {
}

```

*`app/javascript/stores/application/state.js`*
```JavaScript
export const state = {

}
```


## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
