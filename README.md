# Vue::Generators
vue-generators is an opinionated library for generating Vue components and mixins
for a Rails project.

## Usage

### Help
```bash
rails g vue:component -h
rails g vue:mixin -h
```

### Generate a component

```bash
rails g vue:component ButtonCounter
```

*This will generate `app/javascript/components/ButtonCounter.vue`*
```JavaScript
<template>
  <div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'ButtonCounter',

  components: {},

  mixins: [],

  props: {
    /*
    property: {
      type: String|Number|Boolean|Array|Object|Date|Function|Symbol,
      default: null,
      required: false
    },
    */
  },

  data() {
    return {
      // field: 'value'
    }
  },

  computed: {
    // computed properties are cached based on their dependencies
    /*
    computedProperty() {
      return 'value'
    },
    */
  },

  methods: {
    // Methods run whenever a re-render happens, their results aren't cached.
    /*
    onClick() {
      this.$emit('click-happened')
    },
    */
  },

  mounted() {
    // Invoked when the component loads, good place to fetch data from the API
  },
}
</script>

<style lang="stylus" scoped>
</style>
```

### Generate a mixin

```bash
rails g vue:mixin MyMixin
```

*This will generate `app/javascript/mixins/MyMixin.js`*

```JavaScript
export default {
  props: {
    /*
    property: {
      type: String|Number|Boolean|Array|Object|Date|Function|Symbol,
      default: null,
      required: false
    },
    */
  },

  data() {
    return {
      // field: 'value'
    }
  },

  computed: {
    // computed properties are cached based on their dependencies
    /*
    computedProperty() {
      return 'value'
    },
    */
  },

  methods: {
    // Methods run whenever a re-render happens, their results aren't cached.
    /*
    onClick() {
      this.$emit('click-happened')
    },
    */
  },
}
```

## Installation
